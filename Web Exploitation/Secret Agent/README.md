## Solution

When we visit the webpage and click the "Flag" button, we get the error that we are not google, along with our user agent. If we switch our user agent to `Googlebot` and request `/flag`, we will be able to see that it returns the flag.

```js
const fetch = require("node-fetch");
fetch("http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:46162/flag", {
    headers: {
        "User-Agent": "Googlebot"
    }
}).then(r => r.text()).then(text => {
    console.log(text.match(/picoCTF{(.*)}/)[0]);
});
```

Our flag is `picoCTF{s3cr3t_ag3nt_m4n_ac87e6a7}`
