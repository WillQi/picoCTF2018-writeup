# Logon

**Points:** 150

**Description**
> I made a website so now you can log on to! I don't seem to have the admin password. See if you can't get to the flag. `http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:57252` ([link](http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:57252))

**Hints**
> Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for admins?

> How does check the admin's password?

## Solution

We can login using any username other then `admin`, however the page we are redirected to [/flag](http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:57252/flag)  does not contain the flag as we are not the administrator.

If we logout and try to go back to [/flag](http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:57252/flag), we are told to login. Meaning that the website stores somewhere that we are logged in to the site.

If we check our browser cookies we see that it stores the username, password, and if we're the administrator.

By changing the cookie `admin` to `True` and refreshing the page, we can see that the flag is `picoCTF{l0g1ns_ar3nt_r34l_2a968c11}`
