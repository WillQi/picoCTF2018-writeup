# No Login

**Points:** 200

**Description**
> Looks like someone started making a website but never got around to making a login, but I heard there was a flag if you were the admin. `http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:14664` ([link](http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:14664))

**Hints**
> What is it actually looking for in the cookie?

## Solution

The challenge references browser cookies in the hint, and will reveal the flag if we are the admin.

If we set a cookie named `admin` to `1`, and request the [/flag](http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:14664/flag) page. We will find the flag is `picoCTF{n0l0g0n_n0_pr0bl3m_eb9bab29}`
