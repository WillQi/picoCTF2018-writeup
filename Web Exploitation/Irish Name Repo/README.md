## Solution

A common vulnerability with websites that use SQL as their database is SQL injection. We can find a [login](http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:28402/login.html) page on the page's navigation menu.

If you input `'` into either the username or password input, the server will be unable to handle the request and will throw an HTTP 500 error. This means the server is susceptible to SQL injection attacks. Using `' OR 1=1 OR '` as our SQL injection input, we can bypass any checks for username/password input and get the flag.

The flag is `picoCTF{con4n_r3411y_1snt_1r1sh_f58843c5}`
