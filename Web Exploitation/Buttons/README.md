# Buttons

**Points:** 250

**Description**

> There is a website running at `http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:21579` ([link](http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:21579)). Try to see if you can push their buttons.

**Hints**

> What's different about the two buttons?

## Solution

When we open the site, we see a button: ![](Button1.png)

Clicking this button brings us to another button. ![](Button2.png)

Clicking this button will cause [Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to auto-play and, if your volume is on it, may jumpscare you ~~like it did to the person who solved this problem and took one for the team~~. This path does not give you the flag.

So how do we get the flag? By reading the hint, we know there must be a difference in the buttons. If we go back and inspect the code for both buttons, we see that there is something different between them.

Code for Button 1:

`<form action="button1.php" method="POST"> <input type="submit" value="PUSH ME! I am your only hope!"> </form>`

Code for Button 2:

`<a href="button2.php">Button2</a>`

We can change Button 2 to be identical to Button 1 using Inspect Element, except that the form action is `button2.php`. Clicking our new Button 2 will take us to the page with the flag.

The flag is `picoCTF{button_button_whose_got_the_button_ed306c10}`
