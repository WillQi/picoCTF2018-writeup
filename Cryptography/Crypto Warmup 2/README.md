# Crypto Warmup 2

**Points:** 75

**Description**
> Cryptography doesn't have to be complicated, have you ever heard of something called rot13? `cvpbPGS{guvf_vf_pelcgb!}`

**Hints**
> This can be solved online if you don't want to do it by hand!

## Solution

We are given the ciphertext, and we know it needs to be decoded using ROT13.

Using this website, [Dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/rot-13-cipher), we can simply plug in our ciphertext and get the decoded flag.

The flag is `picoCTF{this_is_crypto!}`
