# Crypto Warmup 1

**Points:** 75

**Description**
> Crpyto can often be done by hand, here's a message you got from a friend, `llkjmlmpadkkc` with the key of `thisisalilkey`. Can you use this [table](../Crypto%20Warmup%201/table.txt) to solve it?.


**Hints**
> Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{HELLO}' as the flag.


> Please use all caps for the message.

## Solution

We are given a file called `table.txt`, so let's open that. We opened files using Visual Studio Code because it had better formatting compared to something like Notepad.

Here is our table:  

![VS Table](../Crypto%20Warmup%201/tablevs.PNG)

We recognized this as Vigen√®re Cipher. Rather than decode it by hand like the problem suggests, we can use an online decoder. This is easy to decode because we are also given the key, `thisisalilkey`.

Using [this website, Dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher), we can enter in our key and our ciphertext. Then, we are given the text `secretmessage`.

Now, all we need to do is format it for the flag.

The flag is `picoCTF{SECRETMESSAGE}`
