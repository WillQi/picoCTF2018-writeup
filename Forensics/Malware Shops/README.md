## Solution

To get this flag, we need to analyze the image and answer the questions that are provided when we connect to the shell.

The first question, `How many attackers created the malware in this dataset?` can be found by counting the number of colours in the graph, 5 (red, green, blue, yellow and purple). This answer stays consistent.

The second question, `In the following sample of files from the larger dataset, which file was made by the same attacker who made the file a55f57
2c? Indicate your answer by entering that file's hash.` provides a series of hashes that have a `jmp_count` and `add_count`.

After reading the [`info.txt`](info.txt) file, we know that attacks by the same hacker have similar `jmp_count` and `add_count`. Enter in the hash with the closest `jmp_count` and `add_count` to the first hash (0) provided. Answering this correctly will give you the flag.

The flag is `picoCTF{w4y_0ut_dea1794b}`
